### Introduction
<p style="color:grey;"> The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) Website came online almost 30 years ago, and I'm going to assume that for most of that time, UDC has had some presence on the web via a website. Today, we will investigate the website's current version and highlight three good and lousy design features. We will highlight all the guidelines they violate or adhere to using the guidelines, principles, and theories outlined in Chapter 2.</p>

#### Guidelines Violated
According to [Schneiderman’s Eight Golden Rule](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ben/goldenrules.html), “…identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens; and consistent color, layout, capitalization, fonts, and so on, should be employed throughout.” The UDC website violate the this rule as well as the National Cancer Institute Digital Standards. We observed several instances of inconsistent menu bars on the UDC website that contravene these principle. In the highlighted image above, it is evident that the menu bar changes when navigating between pages.

The military page on the UDC website [www.udc.edu/military](www.udc.edu/military) offers crucial information to veterans and active military personnel. However, upon accessing the Veteran Service Organization page, we noticed discrepancies in the menu bar text size and color scheme, which differ from other pages. This inconsistency makes it challenging for users to navigate the site reliably.

Such inconsistencies can particularly confuse novice users, who may need to re-acquaint themselves with the interface on each page. This results in increased cognitive load diminished usability, and potential user frustration due to unpredictable navigation.

Supporting Principles and Theories
- [Shneiderman’s Rule](https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/ben/goldenrules.html): Striving for consistency ensures that users do not need to adjust their mental model for similar tasks or actions across a system.
- [NCI Digital Standards](https://www.cancer.gov/digital-standards): Consistent navigation patterns reduce cognitive load and ensure accessibility for all users.

#### Recommendations
- Standardize the Menu Bar: Use the same layout, color scheme, and terminology for the menu bar across all pages.
- Follow a Consistent Menu Order: Ensure menu items appear in the same sequence throughout the site.
- Test with Users: Conduct usability testing to confirm that the new menu design is intuitive and accessible for all user groups.
